    <h2>Takeover</h2>
    <p>
        In this game you attempt to take over the government headed by the evil president Xerxes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game is played on a city map which features streets and buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are the rebel forces and the government is played by the computer (me).
    </p>
    <p>
        Points are gained by capturing key buildings and the first player to reach 35 points is the winner.
    </p>

    <h3>How to play</h3>
    <p>
        You and I each take alternate turns, and each turn consists of four consecutive moves.
    </p>
    <p>
    At each move you may either:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Try to take over a building square.<br />
            Each building has a traditional political leaning, loyalty and pro/anti government bias, but this will change as the game progresses according to your popularity.<br />
            The more popular you are, the better the chance of a building coming over to your side.
        </li>
        <li>Try to take over a street square.<br />
            This will also help you to take over buildings at a later date.<br />
            It will also help stop government forces from advancing too far.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If an attempt to take a building or street square is unsuccesfull, then your turn is over!
    </p>

    <h3>The Map</h3>
    <p>
        Taking over a street square is only possible if you already own more surrounding squares (up to 8 buildings or streets) than the opposing colour.
    </p>
    <p>
        Grey neutral squares do not count. The more squares you occupy surrounding a building, the more chance you have of overcoming resisitance in a building.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some buildings are particularly important since they can alter the course of the game if you occupy them. These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The radio station</li>
        <li>The Newspaper Office</li>
        <li>The Cathedral</li>
        <li>The Bank</li>
        <li>The Hospital</li>
        <li>The Airport</li>
        <li>Xerxes' Palace</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The radio station, newspaper office and cathedral are the most important buildings to hold, but you will probably never manage to capture Xerxes' Palace!
